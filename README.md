# What I did
This was my first time creating layout files and learning xml. I wanted to have a clean interface that served only the purpose of meditation and recording stats.
Using sharedpreferences i was able to make this app run offline and allow anyone to just meditate, and see their own stats. 
This project allowed me to further increase my interest in android development and also be able to use javav to create something that I would use.
